**Key design principles:**
- Orchestrator always passes `TaskSpec` objects to agents — never raw text
- Sub-agents always return typed Pydantic models — never free-form strings
- Tool calling is explicit and traceable (DataAgent uses Groq function-calling)
- SummaryAgent only does prose; all computation is done upstream

## Data Generation Design

The 100,000 survey records are generated with deliberate signal:

| Property | Design Decision |
|---|---|
| **Time span** | April 2026 (40%) + May 2026 (60%) |
| **Rating distribution** | April: weighted toward 4–5. May: more 1–2s to create comparison signal |
| **Themes** | 6 themes: food_quality, wait_time, staff, cleanliness, price, app |
| **Free text** | Template pool per theme × sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) |
| **Channels** | mobile 45%, web 30%, kiosk 15%, email 10% |

This is intentionally not random noise — the dataset encodes a story (slight quality dip in May) so the ComparisonAgent has something meaningful to surface.

## RAG Pipeline

**Chunking strategy: Sentence-aware with Q&A block preservation**

1. Split FAQ on `Q:` boundaries → preserves question-answer pairs as atomic units
2. Sentence-split blocks exceeding ~150 tokens
3. Embed with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (local, free, 384-dim)
4. Store in FAISS with cosine similarity (L2-normalized inner product)
5. Retrieve top-3 chunks per query; LLM summarizes into context block

**Why this chunking?** Fixed-size risks splitting a question from its answer. Semantic clustering is overkill for a 500-word document. Q&A block chunking maps directly to user query intents.

## Part 3 — Fine-Tuning Design

### The Problem
GreenLeaf Bistro (and by extension, omniSense) needs to classify 10,000 free-text survey responses per day into 8 sentiment+topic categories (e.g., *Positive – Food Quality*, *Negative – Wait Time*, *Neutral – Staff*). GPT-4o achieves high accuracy but costs ~$0.15 per 1,000 tokens — at this scale, that's $450–$900/day, which doesn't scale. The goal is a fine-tuned smaller model that matches frontier accuracy at 10–20× lower inference cost.

### 1. Data Strategy
Use GPT-4o to label an initial batch of 3,000–5,000 responses with a carefully engineered classification prompt (few-shot with 2 examples per class). Human reviewers spot-check 10–15% of labels, focusing on ambiguous cases (e.g., "The wait was fine but the food was cold" spanning two categories). Target: ~300–500 examples per class (2,400–4,000 total). Augment with back-translation (English → French → English) for underrepresented classes. This gives enough signal for LoRA fine-tuning without needing thousands of examples per class.

### 2. Model & Technique Selection
**Base model:** `google/flan-t5-base` (250M params) or `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`. Prefer Flan-T5 if inference latency is the constraint (encoder-decoder, fast classification), or Mistral-7B if the organization already runs a 7B serving stack and wants one unified model family.

**Technique:** LoRA (r=8, alpha=16, dropout=0.1) on the attention layers. **Rationale:** Full fine-tuning on 7B params requires 4× A100s and is hard to version-control. QLoRA adds quantization noise that hurts precision on an 8-class classifier. LoRA gives 95% of full-FT quality at 1–2% of the trainable parameter count, and the adapter is a ~10MB file that's trivial to version and swap.

### 3. Training Pipeline
**Tooling:** HuggingFace `Trainer` + `PEFT` library (for LoRA) + `datasets` for data loading. Optionally Axolotl for config-driven training if the team wants reproducible YAML-based jobs. Training job structure: tokenize inputs as `"Classify: {free_text}"` → label as one of 8 category strings. Use `Seq2SeqTrainer` for Flan-T5 or `SFTTrainer` for Mistral. Train for 3–5 epochs on 4,000 examples (~30 min on a single A10G). Use cosine LR schedule with warmup.

### 4. Evaluation
Track **macro-F1** (primary — treats all 8 classes equally regardless of frequency), per-class precision/recall, and a confusion matrix. Also track inference latency (p50/p95) and cost-per-1000-requests. **Ready-to-replace threshold:** macro-F1 ≥ 0.90 on held-out test set (10% split), with no individual class F1 below 0.80. Shadow deploy for 48 hours (run both models, compare outputs) before full cutover.

### 5. Serving
Use **vLLM** with LoRA adapter support (`--enable-lora`). The adapter is mounted as a named lora module alongside the base model — requests to the classification route specify `lora_request=LoRARequest("survey_classifier", ...)`. This keeps the base LLM serving other routes (e.g., chat, summarization) untouched. No restart required to add/swap adapters.

### 6. Future-Proofing
The pipeline is made input-agnostic by: (a) a config-driven category list (YAML/JSON) so adding or renaming categories doesn't require code changes, (b) a schema-agnostic input formatter that maps any `{field: value}` survey record to a classification prompt using a template, (c) versioned adapters stored in object storage with semantic versioning, and (d) a labeling pipeline abstracted behind an interface so GPT-4o can be swapped for a different frontier model as labeler without changing the training code.

## What Was Skipped and Why

| Feature | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming API responses | **Implemented (bonus)** | SSE real-time agent tracing in `/api/ask` and Evaluation Lab |
| Re-ranker (cross-encoder) | **Implemented (bonus)** | Two-stage FAISS → cross-encoder reranking in `rag/retrieve.py`; scores shown in UI |
| Full web UI | **Implemented (bonus)** | React + TypeScript SPA with 9 pages, live agent graph, charts |
| Persistent database (PostgreSQL) | Skipped | JSON file is sufficient at 100k records; scope constraint |
| Authentication on FastAPI | Skipped | Out of scope for assessment |
| Async agent execution | Skipped | DataAgent + RAGAgent could run in parallel, but serial execution is clearer for evaluation |
| BM25 hybrid retrieval | Skipped | Dense-only retrieval is sufficient; reranking already improves precision significantly |
